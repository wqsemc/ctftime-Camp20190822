The mafia is using CS:GO to communicate secretly. They are talking about some "flag" but we don't know what to look for. We managed to intercept parts of their communication. Can you make some sense out of this and get this "flag"?

Pwn========
Keychain
Category: Pwn
Difficulty: Premium (i.e. really hard)
Author: LinHe
We've found parts of the source code of a keychain backdoor that has been installed by Kim Jong-un's Agents on Donald Trump's computer. As we're interested in getting Trump's Twitter password, we would like you to find out what the backdoor does and how it can be exploited.
The source code can be found here. https://static.allesctf.net/keychain-4feee5145575351a2741ba4a70ba30618d4397c0.zip
Once you got a working exploit, please:
Send an IRC message to LinHe with a URL to your exploit and
Call Linus: Extension: AAPL (2275) or wait
Hints:
The source code is for a program that patches something in securityd.
The patcher is not that interesting - Just pretend this is macOS <= 10.14.3 but find a different mach port over-deallocation vulnerability.
The flag can be found in the keychain. It is a standard Internet Passwordwith the Name/Account set to @realdonaldtrump. (Or just dump the whole keychain)
This or this might help you. https://youtu.be/wPd6rMk8-gg https://objectivebythesea.com/v2/talks/OBTS_v2_Henze.pdf
Our VM is running macOS 10.14.6 (i.e. the latest version of macOS).
The VM is not connected to the internet.
You will need to find a 0day.

First Blood: Shellphish
You scanned the interwebz for vuln boxes and suddenly:
A wild HSM prototype appeared...
By chance you also found the binary behind the service, but it only contains a PLACEHOLDER masterkey! Can you recover the real key?
Server at: hsm.allesctf.net 4321 (Server currently very unstable, if you wanna work on it online, contact explo1t in irc to get a private instance)
Hint 1: You can now download a modified qemu version, in which you can run the firmare on your host

pwning your kernelz
Category: Pwn
Difficulty: 0day
Author: LinHe
This time we got a real macOS kernel 0day for you! And the bug is super easy to trigger:
x86_saved_state32_t state;
memset(&state, 0xFF, sizeof(x86_saved_state32_t));
thread_set_state(mach_thread_self(), x86_SAVED_STATE32, (thread_state_t) &state, x86_SAVED_STATE32_COUNT);
while (1) {}
Please exploit it to become root. Flag can be found in /flag.
Source code and the kernel we're using can be found here. https://static.allesctf.net/pwning_your_kernelz-5feee5145575351a2741ba4a70ba30618d4397c0.zip
Once you got a working exploit, please:
Send an IRC message to LinHe with a URL to your exploit and
Call Linus: Extension: AAPL (2275) or wait
Hints:
This bug can only be exploited by 32 bit apps, therefore you will need Xcode 9.4.1 or lower.
We're running the latest version of macOS, 10.14.6.
The included kernel is the development kernel from the latest KDK.
You will need to disable SMAP on your mac. This is why we use the development kernel: You can disable SMAP like this (only possible with development kernels): sudo nvram boot-args="-pmap_smap_disable"
SMEP is enabled. The kernel slide will be passed to your exploit in the first argument as hex string (i.e. we will run your program like this: ./exploit 0xDEADBEEF with 0xDEADBEEF being the kernel slide).
Our VM is not connected to the internet.

Note: The server is LD_PRELOADing buffer_read.so to mitigate a short read. You can ping us on IRC if this causes issues with your exploit. https://static.allesctf.net/buffer_read-5fe18e81c36930c00edf04bb6d10ca74a74fbd7aefd79dd2870dd57498bfb28c.so

Garage
Category: Radio
Difficulty: Hard
Author: explo1t
First Blood: Dragon Sleep Pwn Sector
In order to safeguard their flags, the ALLES team has brought their secure storage garages to the camp. They can be opened remotely with transmitters, using military-grade encryption‚Ñ¢. We heard about security issues with similar products, but according to the manufacturer, their garages are secure! Phew.
Only a small number of highly trusted team members carry the transmitters. Unfortunately, one of them got drunk on Tschunk and a transmitter for one of the garages ended up in enemy hands.
You got hold of the remote control and can press the button:http://hax.allesctf.net:8080
Can you raid the second flag vault?
The following parameters might help you:
Symbol Duration: 512u
Sample Rate: 200k
Frequency: 433.920 MHz
The signal is transmitted near Dragon Sleep Pwn Sector (each signal 10 times, bc transmission errors). You can either connect to our remote receiver, or receive the signal locally using the SDR of your choice. For transmitting your solution, please use our submission queue which will allocate a time slot, transmit your signal and provide you with a video feed of the garage.
You cannot physically access the garages.
Update: Contact explo1t on IRC if you believe you have a working exploit.
Update2: New client with increase performance. Increased disconnection time, if no ping (now 120s).
Hint 1: Here is a full Challenge-Response from Garage 1 (The one you can open via the webinterface)


Hint 2: Challenge Message Format:

After compromising the left-pad NPM package by guessing the author's NPM credentials (which happened to be the name of his cat, Lucy), you ended up with a shell somewhere deep inside a random company's continuous integration infrastructure.
Your goal is to escalate your privileges through this multi-stage challenge and pivot through the company network. Each stage of the challenge has its own flag - this is part 1.
